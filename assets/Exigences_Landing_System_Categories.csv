All these operations are done automatically with the hydraulic pressure only.,https://mi-git.univ-tlse2.fr/ECb/LGS/blob/master/cylinders.txt#L16,Behavior,

This scenario is based on the mean values given in the previous table.,https://mi-git.univ-tlse2.fr/ECb/LGS/blob/master/cylinders.txt#L26,Meta-requirement,

Let us consider now that the pressure arrives in the extension circuit.,https://mi-git.univ-tlse2.fr/ECb/LGS/blob/master/cylinders.txt#L31,Behavior,
The gear is unlocked 0.8s later.,https://mi-git.univ-tlse2.fr/ECb/LGS/blob/master/cylinders.txt#L32,Behavior,
It begins moving down. Let us suppose now that the pressure is stopped.,https://mi-git.univ-tlse2.fr/ECb/LGS/blob/master/cylinders.txt#L33,Behavior,
Then the cylinder stops as well in the current position.,https://mi-git.univ-tlse2.fr/ECb/LGS/blob/master/cylinders.txt#L34,behavior,
